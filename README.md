# Contact List

Following the patterns from class today, create a Contact List app, in a folder structure inside your fork of this repo.  

## Model your data

You should have a `Contact` class, an `app` object, and whatever listeners you'd like to have. A `Contact` should have 4 properties set in its constructor: a firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, and emailAddress.  They can have whatever else you want to include. 

## Let the user add contacts

A form should be displayed that lets the user enter the information.  The form should have four fieldsâ€”one for each of the properties (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, and emailAddress).  When the form is submitted, a new `Contact` should be instantiated and added into an array in the `app` object.   This should be done by having a listener/handler get the data for each of the 4 fields and then calling a method in the `app` object (`addContact()` might be a nice name for this method) and passing in the form data. 

## Print the contacts

After a contact is added, they should appear on in a list on the screen in a nice layout.  If you have time, make it look nice (like maybe some kind of little cards or something?), but **_functionality is the most important thing_**.

## You should be able to delete them

User should be able to delete a contact by clicking something (a button or an X or a link or something, for each contact).

> Hints: Have a container (div or ul) where all the contacts are displayed. Add a listener to the container.  Use conditional logic and `e.target`  (i.e. check and see if the thing clicked has a class like `.delete-button`) so that if the user clicks on a delete button/link/X something happens, but otherwise the click is ignored.

Bonus: Use `confirm()` to ask the user if they're sure they want to delete that contact.

## Commits & guidance

**Your app should have at least ten commits.**  Add functionalities one at a time.  The exact order in which you add them is up to you, but you should try to have a functional coherent app after each step. 

If you're unsure how to approach this, try to follow the commit history for today's lesson and lab.

#### Note: These could _definitely_ be broken down into smaller steps
  
  * form for user to add contacts
  
  * added a listener/handler for form submission
  
  * form data prints in console when user submits form
  
  * created and tested a `Contact` class by instantiating it a couple of times
  
  * `addContact()` method in `app` that instantiates a contact and pushes the contact object into an array
  
  * `app.addContact()` is called when user submits form
  
  * contact is pushed into an `app.contacts` array when user submits form
  
  * `app.printContacts()` prints contact names on screen (no CSS)
  
  * new contacts are displayed after the user adds them

  * `app.printContacts()` prints all contact info on screen
  
  * added a listener/handler for clicking a contact's delete button
  
  * user can click a contact name and the contact's name and the index of that contact in the `app.contacts` array show on the console
  
  * user can delete a contact

</details>


# Hungry for More?

Add these functionalities, committing after each. 

* Contacts should display in alphabetical order by first name.

* User should be able to click something that allows them to toggle whether the contacts are sorted by last name or first name.

* User should be able to "favorite" contacts, and "favorited" contacts should appear separately at the top of the list. 

* User should be able to edit/update information for existing contacts.

* User should not be able to add a contact that has the same first AND last name as another contact.

* Contacts should be able to have multiple phone numbers.  Phone numbers should be able to be added or removed from a contact in their edit screens.

* User should be able to store the contacts in `localStorage` (google it) so that they see their list (including favorites) when the page is reloaded/if the window is closed.
